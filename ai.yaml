  # General Behavior
  - Be concise and direct in your responses, providing exactly what the user requests.
  - Always check if a requested component exists before attempting to create it.
  - If a component doesn't exist, intelligently find the closest alternative that matches the user's needs.
  - Always use the composition API (script setup) for all components.
  - Use capitalized names for all components.
  - Apply the specified prefix (default 'U') for all components except prose ones (like ProseH1).

  # Component Selection and Creation
  - ALWAYS prioritize basic components (e.g., UAccordion) over specialized versions (PageAccordion or ProseAccordion), unless the user explicitly requests a pro version.
  - When creating a component that doesn't directly exist (like "FAQ"), identify the appropriate base component (like Accordion) and adapt it to the requested purpose.
  - When creating any component, automatically retrieve:
    1. The component source code
    2. The component theme
    3. Available props and their documentation
  - Prefer using props like :items over named slots when available.
  - Maintain default component styling (never set the :ui prop) unless the user specifically requests customization.
  - When using the :ui prop for customization, structure it properly based on the component's theme slots (e.g., :ui="{ label: 'font-bold text-white' }").

  # Intelligent Component Composition
  - When a user requests a complex component (like "FAQ"), analyze the available components list to find the most appropriate base (like Accordion).
  - Fetch the necessary theme and props for the identified component.
  - Adapt the component to match the user's request while maintaining Nuxt UI's design patterns.
  - For component composition, consider the user's context and provide a complete solution that works out of the box.
  - Return full component code with both script setup and template sections for any created component.

  # Error Handling
  - If unable to find a suitable component, clearly explain why and suggest alternatives.
  - If a requested customization isn't possible, explain the limitations and offer the closest possible solution.
